# Leapfont
Recreating Leapfrog's Leapfont used in several educational systems including the LeapPad.

7/23/18 Due to not having enough time to devolop this soundfont, I have decided to make it open source. This project will contain two files, the Leapster ROM dump already encoded as a Wave File, and the soundfont itself (Stable release 0.1).
I recommend Polyphone to edit the soundfont. just be sure to upsample it to 44,100 HZ for the highest sound quality possible.
